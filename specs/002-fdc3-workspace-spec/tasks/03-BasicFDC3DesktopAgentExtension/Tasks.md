# Tasks: Basic FDC3 DesktopAgent Extension

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-fdc3-workspace-spec/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md
**Feature**: Basic FDC3 DesktopAgent Extension - Implement core FDC3 interoperability features

**Organization**: Tasks are organized to deliver a working FDC3 DesktopAgent that supports context broadcasting and listening within workspace-scoped channels.

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included in this task list as they were not explicitly requested in the specification.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project uses monorepo structure:

- Extensions: `theia-fdc3-extensions/theia-fdc3-extension/src/`
- Tests: `theia-fdc3-extensions/theia-fdc3-extension/tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure for FDC3 DesktopAgent extension

- [X] T001 Create FDC3 extension directory structure in theia-fdc3-extensions/theia-fdc3-extension/src/fdc3/

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Workspaces with isolated context (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable workspace-scoped context broadcasting so apps in one workspace don't affect apps in other workspaces

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - FDC3 context broadcast/listen (Priority: P1)

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Raise intents and resolve handlers (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable apps to raise intents with context and auto-route when one handler exists (resolver UI deferred to later task)

**Independent Test**: Provide one handler app for an intent and confirm it auto-routes correctly

- [X] T032 [US3] Implement findIntentsByContext(context) method in theia-fdc3-extensions/theia-fdc3-extension/src/fdc3/services/desktop-agent.service.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, intents should route to single handlers automatically

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on User Story 1 completion (needs workspace isolation)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (needs broadcast/listen working)
- **FDC3 API Exposure (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Stories 1-3 completion
- **Testing & Validation (Phase 7)**: Depends on Phase 6 completion
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all core implementation being complete

### Critical Path

```
Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí US1 (isolation) ‚Üí US2 (broadcast/listen) ‚Üí US3 (intents) ‚Üí API Exposure ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Polish
```

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (Workspace Isolation)**: Foundation for all FDC3 operations - MUST be first
- **User Story 2 (Broadcast/Listen)**: Requires US1 workspace isolation to be complete
- **User Story 3 (Intents)**: Requires US2 broadcast/listen infrastructure to be working

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1**:

- Models (T011, T012) can run in parallel
- Services depend on models being complete
- Validation depends on all services being implemented

**User Story 2**:

- DesktopAgentImpl skeleton (T017) must be first
- broadcast and addContextListener can be implemented sequentially
- Context validator (T023) can run in parallel with listener implementation

**User Story 3**:

- Models (T024, T025) can run in parallel
- Intent registry before raiseIntent implementation
- findIntent methods can run in parallel with raiseIntent

**Phase 6**:

- Frontend proxy (T033) and backend protocol (T034) can run in parallel
- RPC communication depends on both proxy and protocol
- Module bindings depend on RPC being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

```bash
# Setup phase - all parallelizable:
T003 (TypeScript config) || T004 (DI bindings)

# Foundational phase - types can run in parallel:
T006 (Context types) || T007 (Intent types) || T008 (Channel types)

# User Story 1 - models in parallel:
T011 (Workspace model) || T012 (Channel model)

# User Story 3 - models in parallel:
T024 (Intent model) || T025 (IntentResolution model)

# API Exposure - frontend and backend in parallel:
T033 (Frontend proxy) || T034 (Backend protocol)

# Polish phase - documentation in parallel:
T048 (JSDoc) || T049 (Error handling) || T050 (Logging)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Workspace Isolation)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Broadcast/Listen)
5. Complete Phase 6: API Exposure (partial - enough to test)
6. Complete Phase 7: Testing & Validation (partial - test broadcast/listen only)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test broadcast/listen with workspace isolation
8. Deploy/demo if ready

This MVP delivers the core value proposition stated in the task specification:

> "The platform now has a working (even if basic) FDC3 DesktopAgent. Apps can call `fdc3.broadcast` and the messages are routed to the appropriate listeners in the same workspace."

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Isolation) ‚Üí Test independently
3. Add User Story 2 (Broadcast/Listen) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo (MVP!)**
4. Add User Story 3 (Intents) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add API Exposure ‚Üí Test with real apps
6. Add Testing & Validation ‚Üí Full validation
7. Add Polish ‚Üí Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Sequential implementation required due to dependencies:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Isolation)
   - Wait for US1 completion
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Broadcast/Listen)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (Intents) - can start after US2
   - Developer C: Testing apps (T041-T043) - can start after US2
3. Parallel work on Phase 6 (API Exposure) after US3 complete
4. Parallel work on Phase 8 (Polish) after validation

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story builds on previous ones (workspace isolation ‚Üí broadcast/listen ‚Üí intents)
- Stop at MVP checkpoint (after US2) to validate core value before proceeding
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Testing tasks (Phase 7) validate the entire implementation
- Focus is on broadcast/listen as stated in task specification: "The main methods we're initially interested in are around broadcasts only"

---

## Constitution Alignment

This implementation aligns with the constitution requirements:

- **Theia-Conformant Foundation**: All functionality delivered as Theia extensions with proper DI bindings
- **Context-First Workflow Model**: Workspaces represent business contexts; Desktop Agent scopes messages per workspace
- **FDC3-First Interoperability**: Implements broadcast/listen/intents per FDC3 specification
- **Modular Extension Architecture**: Clear extension boundary for FDC3 Desktop Agent with activation conditions
- **VS Code Extension Compatibility**: FDC3 API exposed through extension mechanisms compatible with VS Code extensions
- **Workspace UX & Productivity**: Context routing respects workspace boundaries
- **Enterprise Quality & Security**: Message origin validation, privacy-conscious logging, workspace isolation
- **Cross-Platform & Hybrid Delivery**: RPC-based architecture works in both browser and Electron

---
